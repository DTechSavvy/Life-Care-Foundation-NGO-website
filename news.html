    <p><strong>3. Quotes</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>1. DONATE TO SUPPORT THE CAUSE</strong></p>
    <p>Giving to charity makes you feel good; donating to charity is a major mood-booster. The knowledge that you're helping others is hugely empowering and, in turn, can make you feel happier and more fulfilled.</p>
    
    <p><strong>2. MAKE CHANGE HAPPEN, VOLUNTEER</strong></p>
    <img src="html/images/laundry facility.jpg" alt="Volunteer Image">
    <p>Volunteering increases your social and relationship skills. While some people are naturally outgoing, others are shy and have a hard time meeting new people. Volunteering gives you the opportunity to practice and develop your social skills, since you are meeting regularly with a group of people with common interests.</p>

    <p><strong>3. "It's not how much we give but how much love we put into giving"</strong></p>
    <img src="/imagesnews.jpg" alt="Charity Quote Image">
    <p>If you haven't got any charity in your heart, you have the worst kind of heart trouble. Every good act is charity. A man's true wealth hereafter is the good that he does in this world to his fellows.</p>
